      <h1>KTU</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Today almost all colleges in Kerala are affiliated to KTU University, a Kerala’s own Government University.

Currently, 164 colleges in Kerala are affiliated by KTU University. Kerala Technological University (KTU) was its first name when it came into existence on May 21, 2014, which later got changed to APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University..</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-black">The main focus of this university to improve the academic standards of the Graduate, Post Graduate and Research Programmes in Engineering Science, Technology, and Management.

KTU University was established on May 21, 2014, through an ordinance by Government of Kerala, formulating the KTU Act 2015.
It was in 2015 when it KTU actually applied to colleges and started its first batch of students.
The tagline put forward by KTU is – “Live the life together @ KTU Academics, Research & Entrepreneurship”.

Their main office is located inside CET (College of Engineering), Trivandrum campus.

You can contact them anytime for Technical Support For E-Governance Portal by email on support@ktu.edu.in or Phone: 0471-2593120, 2593128, 2590029..</p>

    <div class="w3-twothird">
      <h1>Aim & Vision</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">One of the greatest vision by KTU University had was to inculcate the outcome based education in colleges of Kerala. It generally means more knowledge through practical and experiment based studies.

This is a great initiative, but implementing this properly in our college will be the most difficult part.

But well… They are taking effort.

KTU University has its own official site (https://ktu.edu.in/home.htm) where it announces the new events, orders, and further announcements.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-black">This site is to be followed by every KTU student throughout their college life, to keep track of new syllabus or exam schedule changes.

Cool fact… I would recommend you follow KTU Study on Facebook or Whatsapp to stay updated with the university announcements. You definitely should!

Unlike the previous Kerala university, KTU University has consistent feedbacks on faster and timely exam publication.
The area which tears students mentality is during KTU answer sheet assessment. It’s so much obfuscated, that we students don’t understand who evaluates the answer paper.

I will keep that talk separate for the next section.

The online [E-Gov] platform by KTU provides students access to their marks and data sheet online.</p>
